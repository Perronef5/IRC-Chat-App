# Net Centric Programming Project 1 (Chat Client and Chat Server)

This is a chat application that follows the IRC Protocol. The application was built in python and I used tkinter for the GUI.
In this application you can chay with multiple users and join multiple channels by navigating through the tabs. This was
all made possible by using sockets.   

## Getting Started ##

Step 1) To get started first open up the project in PyCharms or any IDE your prefer. 
Step 2) Then start up the ChatServer.py and Main.py.
Step 3) You should now see the application. Now click on connect and input your host name and port number.
Step 4) Enjoy the Chat App! :)

## Prerequisites ##

In order to successfully run this application you should have tkinter and python3 installed on your computer.
